SIMPLE TIME TRACKER APP

stack: Vue.js, vuetify.

Goal:
An application that allows users to track their time expenditures, specifying categories, and later review the spent time in the context of life spheres, urgency, and importance.

Roadmap:

0. Add sound on timer/pause end;
1. Adding new tags and removing unused ones;
2. Displaying time spent in hours on graphs;
3. Additional graphs with filtering by tags, allowing users to select a primary tag and "sub-tags";
4. Additional graphs showing changes in time spent on categories/tags over weeks and months;
5. "Attaching" tags to life spheres for displaying only necessary tags;
6. Timer feature.
